# Volume-control-using-python-OpenCV
##INTRODUCTION
Computers can better grasp human body language thanks to gesture recognition. Instead of using only the simple text user interfaces or graphical user interfaces(GUIs), this aids in creating a stronger connection between humans and technology . In this gesture recognition experiment, a computer camera interprets the movements of the human body. This information is subsequently used as input by the computer to handle applications. The goal of this project is to create an interface that dynamically captures human hand gestures and controls volume.

##Pyhon Libraries Used

-NumPy : is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

-Pycaw : Python Audio Control Library

-Mediapipe : MediaPipe offers ready-to-use yet customizable Python solutions as a prebuilt Python package. MediaPipe Python package is available on PyPI for Linux, macOS and Windows. It s an open-source machine learning library of Google, which has some solutions for face recognition and gesture recognition, and provides encapsulation of python, js and other languages. MediaPipe Hands is a high-fidelity hand and finger tracking solution. It uses machine learning (ML) to infer 21 key 3D hand information from just one frame. We can use it to extract the coordinates of the key points of the hand.
